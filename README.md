## SincNet Architecture and the paper Speaker Recognition from raw waveform with SincNet - Mirco Ravanelli, Yoshua Bengio

### Abstract 

In recent years, Machine Learning has achieved many outstanding achievements, promoting the rapid development of Technology Revolution 4.0. One of the most powerful factors coming from Deep Learning, learning models based on these methods have been very successful, achieving a promising performance, for many various tasks in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Pattern Recognition, Biometrics Recognition, ...

In recognition task, especially Voice/ Speech Recognition is almost a difficult problem for many years, it takes very complicated methods to solve. Due to Deep Learning, the solution must be feasible, especially with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that bring promising results when only direct input is the raw voice sample. Instead of using standard manual features, CNNs later learned to represent low-level voices from waveforms, potentially allowing the network to better capture critical narrow-band speaker characteristics such as pitch and formants.

For the purpose of researching scientific articles, as well as finding out machine learning models and methods that have emerged recently in important tasks, namely identification. Our group decided to choose a scientific paper as the main implementation document for the subject project.

### Introduction 

As we know about voice is the most accessible biometric trait as no extra acquisition device or transmission system is needed because more and more people all over the world use mobile phone to talk together, the number of telephone landlines in operation increase everyday and the development of social network. However, the voice trait is not only related with personal characteristics, but also with many environmental and sociolinguistic variables. Fortunately, state-of-the-art technologies and applications are presently able to compensate for all those sources of variability allowing for efficient and reliable value-added applications that enable remote authentication or voice detection based just in telephone-transmitted voice signals. Moset of these state of the art methods based on the i-vectors representation of speech segments, significantly improved over the Gaussian Mixture Model-Universal Background Models and development of the Deep Neural Network contributed to the resolution of perception. voice form. However, there are still many problems to be solved with this problem such as the input data problem, optimizing the error, increasing the convergence performance and especially how to design a compact, fine-tunable model. are to match our applications.
